# The server part
Install Python 3+ and all packages used here. Also install OpenCV and FFMPEG (I used brew)

You see the progress in all python files. The last one is a combination of all code

You need to use the rosetta version of python to run mediapipe unfortunately
- `arch -x86_64 /usr/local/homebrew/opt/python@3.8/bin/python3 -m venv myvenv`
Source the venv
- `source myvenv/bin/activate`
- `python test5.py`
